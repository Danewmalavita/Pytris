Pytris Beta 1.0

2025 Danew Malavita

This is a simple Tetris game coded in Python.
IMPORTANT: It requires the pygame library to run. 

Please install the pygame library before installing it with the command 
pip install pygame

Exe compiled with pyinstall (Can found it on compile/dist folder)

Found minor bugs:

1- The mid music doesn't play when toggles on and in game restart (Im working on it!)
2- When toggles off music and toggles on again, appears the last F of the Word OFF
3- The cyan piece doesn't watch perfectly on next piece.
